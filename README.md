# Pharmacy Collaboration Lab
This project aims to create a simulated drug development lab that connects pharmacy students and collaborators. Through an automated form, users will be evaluated based on their skills and interests, and customized responses will be generated for acceptance into the collaboration.

## Objective
- Automate the selection process for potential collaborators.
- Facilitate a collaborative environment for pharmacy and drug development simulation.

## How to Contribute
Detailed instructions will be provided as the project progresses.




## Setting Up the Project Locally
